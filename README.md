# Simple-Projects

Overview

This repository contains various projects demonstrating my ability to work with SQL, Python, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel. While these projects are  simple, they highlight my ability to analyze data, automate processes, and generate insights. I am fully capable of handling more complex and challenging tasks.

Tools Used

•	SQL: Extracted, analyzed, and manipulated data for better decision-making.

•	Python: Used for automation, data processing, and analysis.

•	Tableau: Created interactive dashboards to visualize key insights.

•	Power BI: Designed reports to track inventory and material management.

•	Excel : Used for data organization, analysis, and reporting.


Project Highlights

•	Data Analysis: Extracted, processed, and visualized data to gain meaningful insights.

•	Automation: Utilized Python scripts to streamline tasks and improve efficiency.

•	Visualization: Built dashboards in Tableau and Power BI to present data effectively.

•	Inventory & Asset Management: Applied analytics to optimize stock control and material tracking.

Together, these skills align with the role’s requirements in inventory monitoring, lifecycle assessment, and reporting, demonstrating my capability to support efficient inventory and asset management processes

Additional Note Due to the unavailability of free versions for MS Project and SAP, I was unable to create projects using these tools. However, I have a strong understanding of their functionalities and can quickly adapt to using them in a professional setting.
